                <p>I'm a computer programming student with a focus in UX Design and Web Development. I have a Bachelors in Psychology from Seattle Pacific University, where I did a moderate amount of lab research.<br>
                Currently, I work as an LMT, and I love the challenges that come with injury specific treatment. Like programming, it's a process of using available information (symptoms within the entire body system), logic (discerning injury specific symptoms, treatment options), and problem solving (forming treatment plans). I like that web development feels like a very similar process. I'm passionate about the design process, I'm particularly fond of CSS.</p>
